# Challenege

The challenge asks us to solve:

````
[ W E = 360 ]
   [ S N S = 360 ]
   [ N E W S = ? ]
````

# Solution

First I let `W E = 360 = S N S = 360`, then I solved for `S` to get `S = (W E)-N/2 = 180-N/2`. Next I knew that we had to guess `N`. I guessed `N = 1` and let `N E W S = W E S N S - S = 360+360-180/N = 360+360-180 = 540` which was our flag. `t3n4ci0us{540}`
