# Challenge
We need to find what country Jonah is travelling to next from his online diary that he just pushed changes to. We know that his usernames have been relatively similar and that his Twitter username was `@jonahexplorer`. 

# Sherlock
We can use Sherlock to find reused usernames accross diferent websites.
