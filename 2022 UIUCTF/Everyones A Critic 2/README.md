`<h1>`Challenge `</h1>`

`<br>`The Challenge builds off of Everyone's A' Critic 1. After finding the video game contents reviewer who is reviewing UIUCTF, you have to find his YouTube channel. First I searched for YouTube, I then searched for "Chuck Lephuke" in the top right hand center search bar.`</br>`
