`<h1>`Challenge `</h1>`

`<p>`The Challenge builds off of Everyone's A' Critic 1. After finding the video game contents reviewer who is reviewing UIUCTF, you have to find his YouTube channel. First I searched for YouTube, I then searched for "Chuck Lephuke" in the top right hand center search bar.`</p>`

<h1>YouTube Channel</h1>

<p>I noticed the first user had the same name and profile picture as the discord user from Everyone's A Critic 1, so I clicked on this user to see his YouTube profile.</p>
