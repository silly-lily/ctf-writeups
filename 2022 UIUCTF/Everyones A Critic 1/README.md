<h1>Challenge</h1>

`<p>`The Challenge asks you to find a video game reviews content creator who has somehow ended up reviewing UIUCTF on the UIUCTF Discord. First I opened my computer's discord app, then I went to the UIUCTF discord server. I then searched for "review" in the top right hand corner.`</p>`

<h1>Messages</h1>

<p>I noticed the discord user Chuck.Lephuke wrote that he was going to review the event in the introductions channel, so I decided to look closer at his messages.</p>

<h1>Flag</h1>

<p>Upon finding these messages, I decided to take a look at Chuck.Lephuke's discord profile. I clicked on his name and found the flag as a discord role. </p>
